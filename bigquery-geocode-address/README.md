# Geocode Address in BigQuery

**Author**: Google Maps Platform (**[https://mapsplatform.google.com](https://mapsplatform.google.com)**)

**Description**: Enables running geocoding functions directly in BigQuery queries using Geocoding API by Google Maps Platform.



**Details**: Use this extension to fetch latitude and longitude for an address or calculate driving time between two addresses within your BigQuery queries using a familiar SQL syntax. You can easily query the latitude and longitude of addresses stored inside a BigQuery table, or query the best driving time between two addresses.

When installed, this extension deploys and adds two BigQuery Remote Functions to your BigQuery instance. These are Cloud Functions that call the Geocoding API and the Distance Matrix API, and can be used directly in your BigQuery queries. Sample queries will be provided after install to help you understand the syntax.

### Retrieve latitude and longitude for an address

```sql
latLong(address: STRING): Given an address, returns the latitude and longitude as a JSON string.
```

### Calculate the best driving time between two addresses

```sql
drivingTime(origin: STRING, destination: STRING): Given an origin and destination address, returns the driving time in seconds as a JSON string.
```

### Pre-requisites

* BigQuery dataset: You'll need a BigQuery dataset to use with the extension. You can either create a new dataset or use an existing one. Remember to provide the dataset ID during the extension installation.
* Google Maps Platform API key: Enable the Google Maps Platform API for your project and obtain an API key. Follow the instructions provided in the Google Maps documentation to set up your API key.

### Additional Setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've set up a BigQuery instance in your Google Cloud Platform project.

Additionally, make sure that you've [enabled the Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/cloud-setup) and the [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/cloud-setup#enabling-apis) for your project and obtained an [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key). You will be asked to provide this API key during installation.


### Billing

To install an extension, your project must be on the Blaze (pay as you go) plan.

You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).

This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:

* [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing)
* [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/usage-and-billing)
* Cloud Functions (Node.js 14+ runtime. See [FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))




**Configuration Parameters:**

* BigQuery Dataset ID: The ID of the dataset where the extension will create a connection.

* Maps API key: The key to use for the Maps API. You can get a key from the [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview).

* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).



**Cloud Functions:**

* **createBigQueryConnection:** Creates a BigQuery connection and creates BigQuery Remote Functions using the connection.

* **getLatLong:** Remote Function to retrieve latitude and longitude of a given address.

* **getDrivingTime:** Remote Function to calculate the driving time between two addresses.



**APIs Used**:

* bigquery.googleapis.com (Reason: Powers all BigQuery tasks performed by the extension)

* bigqueryconnection.googleapis.com (Reason: Allows the extension to create a BigQuery connection)

* geocoding-backend.googleapis.com (Reason: Allows the extension to get information such as latiutude and longitue from addresses)

* distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com (Reason: Allows the extension to calculate driving times between two addresses)



**Access Required**:



This extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:

* bigquery.jobUser (Reason: Allows the extension to create BigQuery jobs)

* bigquery.dataOwner (Reason: Allows the extension to create BigQuery routines)

* bigquery.connectionAdmin (Reason: Allows the extension to create a BigQuery connection)
