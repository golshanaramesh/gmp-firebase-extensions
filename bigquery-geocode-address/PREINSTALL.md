## How This Extension Works

Use this extension to perform the following operations in a BigQuery table:
* Retrieve the latitude and longitude for stored addresses.
* Calculate the best driving time between two stored addresses.

This extension adds two [BigQuery Remote Functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/remote-functions) to your BigQuery instance that can be used directly in your BigQuery queries. These remote functions use the [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) and [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview) from Google Maps Platform.

### Retrieve latitude and longitude for an address

Use the following query syntax to retrieive latitude and longitude for addresses stored in your BigQuery table with the `latLong` remote function:

```sql
latLong(address: STRING): Given an address, returns the latitude and longitude as a JSON string.
```

### Calculate the best driving time between two addresses

Use the following query syntax to Calculate the best driving time between two addresses stored in your BigQuery table with the `drivingTime` remote function:

```sql
drivingTime(origin: STRING, destination: STRING): Given an origin and destination address, returns the driving time in seconds as a JSON string.
```

## Before installing

To use this extension, you will need a BigQuery instance to install the extension into and a dataset with addresses.

Before installing this extension, take the following actions in your Firebase project:
* [Upgrade to the Blaze pricing plan](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/firebase-pricing-plans#upgrade-spark-to-blaze). Blaze plan is required to install any extension.
* [Enable the Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_EnableSpecificAPI&_gl=1*17pcy1v*_ga*NzE3NDA4NzkuMTY4MzU4MTE3NA..*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTY4MzU5Njk5NS40LjEuMTY4MzU5NzE4Ny4wLjAuMA..).
* [Enable the Distance Matrix API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_EnableSpecificAPI&_gl=1*17pcy1v*_ga*NzE3NDA4NzkuMTY4MzU4MTE3NA..*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTY4MzU5Njk5NS40LjEuMTY4MzU5NzE4Ny4wLjAuMA..).
* [Obtain a Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key). You must provide this API key during installation.

## Billing

To install an extension, your project must be on the Blaze (pay as you go) plan.

You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).

This extension uses the following Firebase and Google Cloud services which may have associated charges if you exceed the serviceâ€™s no-cost tier:

* Geocoding API - [see pricing](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing)
* Distance Matrix API - [see pricing](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/usage-and-billing)
* BigQuery - [see pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#bigquery-pricing)
* Cloud Functions for Firebase (1st gen) - [see pricing](https://firebase.google.com/functions/pricing)
