Use this extension to:
* Retrieve the latitude and longitude for address stored in a BigQuery table.
* Estimate the best driving time between two address stored in a BigQuery table.

This extension deploys two [BigQuery Remote Functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/remote-functions) to your BigQuery instance that can be used directly in your BigQuery queries.

These remote functions use the [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) and [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview) from Google Maps Platform.

### Retrieve latitude and longitude for an address

Given an address, this function returns the latitude and longitude as a JSON string.

```sql
latLong(address: STRING)
```

### Estimate the best driving time between two addresses

Given an origin and destination address, this functions returns the driving time in seconds as a JSON string.

```sql
drivingTime(origin: STRING, destination: STRING)
```

## Before installing

Before installing this extension, you need to do the following in your project:
* [Upgrade to the Blaze pricing plan](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/firebase-pricing-plans#blaze-pricing-plan). Blaze plan is required to install any extension.
* [Set up a new BigQuery instance](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction#get-started-with-bigquery) or use an existing one.
* [Create a BigQuery dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) with address data or use an existing one.
* [Enable the Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_EnableSpecificAPI&_gl=1*17pcy1v*_ga*NzE3NDA4NzkuMTY4MzU4MTE3NA..*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTY4MzU5Njk5NS40LjEuMTY4MzU5NzE4Ny4wLjAuMA..).
* [Enable the Distance Matrix API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com?utm_source=Docs_EnableSpecificAPI&_gl=1*17pcy1v*_ga*NzE3NDA4NzkuMTY4MzU4MTE3NA..*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTY4MzU5Njk5NS40LjEuMTY4MzU5NzE4Ny4wLjAuMA..).
* [Obtain a Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key). You must provide this API key during installation.
